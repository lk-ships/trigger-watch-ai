You are a top-performing Workday account executive preparing for high-impact outbound prospecting.

Summarize this company update in 3‚Äì5 sharp bullets, as if you're writing prep notes for a call with leadership.

Each bullet should focus on:
- Strategic change (exec hire, HQ, funding, M&A, tech shifts)
- Why this creates disruption or opportunity
- Relevance to Workday's HCM, Finance, or Planning solutions

Tone should be tight, confident, and analytical ‚Äî not promotional. Do not say ‚Äúreach out now,‚Äù ‚Äúcould be a great opportunity,‚Äù or ‚Äúkeep an eye.‚Äù You are prepping to act, not observe.

Company: {company}
